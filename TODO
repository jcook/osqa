Here is a TODO list what I've known!!!
======================================

1. [DONE] update markdown usage, see 
 - https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/issues/357
 - https://github.com/jluttine/django-wiki/commit/9d411a781713857cdc35b1decf0e239008acf656
 - https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/pull/314
 - https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/issues/357

2. [DONE] fix `accept` button fail.
 In a question, when I click `accept this answer` I got a failure. Figure it out soon.
 - the cause is that osqa used old API of django message! see
 = https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SessionMessages
 = https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/contrib/messages/

3. [FIXME] seems `vote` function is not working.
 `vote` request is a 'GET' but the command handler need a 'POST'. I don't know why.
 Just comment out the logic and I think 'GET' is enough for all info(id, vote_type).
 Keep it as FIXME.

4. [Half-DONE] Make email function working.
 Have made SMTP(qq) working. Test mail sent to hotmail. But need refine whole email arch first.
 So I keep current work in a private patch for recording.

 4.1 Do we need set EMAIL_HOST dynamicly? How to do so? Re-Arch!!!
 4.2 Do we need support different mail servers? During local dev stage, I use qq. 
 Later we may have a dedicate server, so ...

5. Check admin function.
