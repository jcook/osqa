AZRJ - Ai Zai Ren Jian
======================

Forked from [OSQA][1]. Will customize the whole site to fit our needs.

Current idea is that here will be a *community* between **cancer patients** or
other **relevant people** which contains **Q&A** at least and some other
positive modules.

In spite of there is not a full picture in my mind, I'll try my best to draw it.

Hope you can find what you need here. We are together always!

## About the name

AZRJ is the acronym of **Ai Zai Ren Jian** which is a Chinese word in spell.
In Chinese pronunciation, it could be translated into
**Cancer is in the world** or **Love is in the world**.
I prefer latter if let me choose. How about you?
